### Problems

IRL projects, definitely there would be PRs that contains a lot of changes (thousands of lines, 50+ files). 
For those PRs, even you have 10 people to review, they still won't cover everything 100%. Simply because it is too much.

Everybody loves small PRs and that is the undeniable fact. But how can we achieve it?

Welcome to DevFlag!

### Solutions
DevFlag will help you to achieve that. Not only the tool, but also require a bit of your critical thinking.

Before starting development, you need to ensure:

- The scope, the changes that you will do (aka Technical Breakdown)
  - This is the most important phase, you need to finalize the:
    - Schema changes: avoid updating too much
    - Code
- Create a DevFlag
- Start the development

## Usage

### Add a new Flag

Open the `app/devflag.php`, prepare your application's environments. Add your flag into all envs:

```php
return [
    'local' => [
        'useNewFeature' => true,
    ],
    'testing' => [
        'useNewFeature' => true,
    ],
    'staging' => [
        'useNewFeature' => false,
    ],
    'production' => [
        'useNewFeature' => false,
    ],
];
```

### Check

Func-way:

```php
function transfer(): ?Transaction
{
    $useNewFeature = useDevFlag('useNewFeature');

    if (!$useNewFeature) {
        return null;
    }

    // doing awesome things
    
    return $transaction;
}
```

OOP/DI-way:

```php
use ShipSaaS\DevFlag\Contracts\DevFlagInterface;

public function __construct(private DevFlagInterface $devFlag) {}

public function transfer(): mixed
{
    if (!$this->devFlag->can('useNewFeature')) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // handle new things
}
```
